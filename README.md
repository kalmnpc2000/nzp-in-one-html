# Nazi Zombies Portable (NZP)

This project is a modernized distribution of **Nazi Zombies Portable (NZP)**, delivered as a single HTML file for maximum simplicity.  
Originally developed as a fan-made Quake-based port of *Call of Duty Zombies* for PSP, NZP has grown into a lightweight, fully portable experience that can now be run directly from your browser WITHOUT hosting it as a website.

## How It Works
- **Single file** — Just download and double-click the HTML file to launch.  
- **Wi-Fi required on first boot** — the game pulls latest build from NZPs offical WebGL repo
- **Offline version in progress** — a fully self-contained build is being developed to remove the Wi-Fi requirement.

## Features
- Classic *Nazi Zombies* gameplay adapted for portable and browser-based play  
- Simple double click to launch
- Easy to run

## Development
This repository provides the latest version of the NZP WebGL build (one day it will be fully offline... one day...) 
Contributions, bug reports, and community feedback are always welcome. (anything to do with the game itself and **NOT** to it launching post the issue in **WebGL Builds Repository**: [https://github.com/nzp-team/nzp-team.github.io](https://github.com/nzp-team/nzp-team.github.io) )
